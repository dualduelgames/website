# Spent Shells RPG

**By Ryan Dallaire - May 2025**

Items could work like spells, you roll to see if they work or if you find enough parts. Bullets are currency. Roll 3D6 \+ stat vs a target number.

## Stats

Stats start anywhere from \-2 to \+6. Your character type determines how you generate your stats. There are 2 categories of stats, physical and mental.

### **Physical Stats**

Might \- strength, endurance, bravery, intimidation  
Deft  \- accuracy, coordination, agility, dexterity

### **Mental Stats**

Clever \- knowledge, perception, problem solving, creativity  
Social \- persuasion, culture, insight, deception

### **Health**

starts at a value based on your character type. Average health for a new character is 15\. 

### **Skills**

Skills are descriptions for a type of roll you get a \+2 bonus to. Such as being good at athletics, it could apply to rolls you make with any stat. A skill can be improved later on, increasing the bonus from \+2 to \+4.  
*Skills shouldn’t be too broad or too narrow. “Combat” is too broad but “AK-47” is too narrow and the player might not be able to ever use it. “Firearms” is a good mid-point and won’t become an issue for the GM to create challenges where it can be used.*

### **Durability**

Items have a durability score that represents how far they are from breaking down. After each scene where the item was used, the player has to roll a D6 to see if the item deteriorates. It deteriorates if the result was a 1 and its durability score decreases by 1\. An item that deteriorates to zero durability is broken and must be repaired.

### **Abilities**

Abilities have limited uses. Each ability has a limit to how often it can be used. There are At-will abilities that can be used once every turn. Encounter abilities that can be used once per encounter or scene. And Daily abilities that can be used once each (in-game) day. If an ability (like a chaos mutation) changes or is replaced, then its uses are reset as if it had not been used that day. There are also passive abilities that have a constant effect that is always active.

### **Currency**

Currency is bullets, they are abstracted and work with any gun. Only things like rockets or grenades are tracked as separate ammo. Each bullet you fire keeps you further away from harm, but prevents you from buying more gear.

### **Armour**

Armour decreases incoming damage by a little and can be used to prevent more by letting the armor take the damage. The damage is dealt to the armour’s durability score. A shield also decreases damage in melee by 1 but you can also destroy your shield to block all damage from a single melee attack. Roll a durability check for your armour and shield if you were hit by an attack during the combat.

### **Weapons And Attacks**

Weapons deal different amounts of damage. There is a quick reference table for categorizing things that are being used as weapons. Also melee weapons can be destroyed in order to reroll an attack. Giving you another chance to hit, but you lose the weapon.  
To attack, you roll a test and try to beat the target’s TN. If you succeed, you deal the weapon’s damage plus the amount you beat the TN. After the battle you will have to roll for weapon durability.

### **Chaos Mutations**

Random mutations from chaos zones can affect everyone and change regularly. They can apply to every type of character except robots.

### **Critical Success**

If you roll three 6s when making a skill check or attack, you get a critical success. Usually this means you get the best possible outcome. It is up to the GM what that is, but often it instantly kills a creature you were attacking.

### **Stunting**

If you roll doubles when you succeed an attack or skill check, you get a bonus based on the value of the third die. There are multiple ways to use the stunt bonus.

### **Effort tests**

For some situations, there is a certain amount of “effort” needed to succeed at a task. Each successful check lets you roll 1D6 and add it to the running total of “effort”. Depending on the difficulty of the test, you need a total effort to finish the task. These are great for tests where the length of time it takes is more important than whether you succeed or fail.

### **Critical Failure**

If you roll three 1s when making a skill check or attack, you get a critical failure. Usually this means you get the worst possible outcome. It is up to the GM what that is, but often that means hitting an ally with your attack or breaking your equipment.

### **Difficulty Target Numbers**

Easy (11), Normal (13), Medium (15), Tough (17)

### **Damage**

Light (1d6 or 3\) \- One handed weapon, poison  
Medium (1d6+2 or 5\) \- minions  
Heavy (2d6 or 7\) \- two handed weapon, monster  
Extreme (2d6+2 or 9\) \- grenades, boss

### **Actions**

You get 2 actions per turn. Can perform the same action twice.  
Move \- Move up to 6 meters, or half that through difficult terrain.  
Grapple \- Make a Might roll to grab a target or an item.  
Climb \- Move your character but a Deft/Might roll every 4 meters you move.  
Attack \- Make an attack roll against a target in range.  
Aim \- Add \+2 to the next attack you make this turn.  
Dodge \- Add \+2 to the next dodge test you make before your next turn.  
Hide \- Roll to try and hide from anyone who can’t currently see you.  
Interact \- Pull a lever, grab something from your bag, etc…  
Ability \- Do whatever the ability says.

### **Range**

Touch (1 meter) \- right up next to you  
Close (2 meters) \- a step away  
Near (6 m) \- across the room  
Far (12 m) \- across the street  
Very Far (24+ m) \- even further

# Story:

**The Old World**  
No one knows exactly what caused the end of the old world. But ever since then, life has been a struggle. Ruined buildings lie everywhere, great storms circle the planet, never ending but always moving. Changes began to happen to the things still living here. Some mutated, others gained strange powers. The robotic machines that once kept the old world running have sentience and now wander the world looking for a new purpose.  
**The Great Desert**  
The great never ending storms that circle the planet have created a large desert wasteland stretching across most of the continent. Only small plants can grow there. Water is scarce. Few animals live above the ground. Across the wasteland are settlements. Such as in the mountains that provide a supply of metals. Trading posts are your last chance to resupply if you are trying to cross these inhospitable lands.  
Our story begins at one such trading post. The only place nearby to prepare for expeditions into the wasteland, it is considered neutral territory and the local factions don’t fight within eyesight of the town. So when people in the town started disappearing, everyone was unsure of who to blame. Over the past month, three people have gone missing. Leaders of each faction have met up, but it always ends in finger pointing and arguing.

As outsiders who have never been to the town before, you have been invited to come and help solve the mystery. You have no connections to any of the factions in this area, and are therefore trusted more than the locals. The reward is a lucrative trading deal for the settlements you come from.

### **Scene 0: Arrival At The Town Of Cheeks**

As you crest a rocky crag, the great desert expands to the horizon as far as you can see. The trail leads to the trading post at the base of two hills. As you approach, you see a small group leaving and heading out into the desert.  
The trading post stands weathered but sturdy against the backdrop of a desolate landscape, nestled near the base of a couple rugged hills. The aptly named “Cheeks”, due to the way the two hills look from afar. Salvaged metal sheets patched together form its walls, adorned with faded graffiti. Tattered banners flap in the wind, marking the town as neutral territory.

As you enter the town, you are greeted by a group of representatives from local factions. They direct you through the streets to a building in the center of town. A diverse array of individuals bustle about the narrow streets, their faces weathered by hardship, yet marked with a resilience borne of survival. Traders haggle over goods salvaged from the ruins of the old world, while craftsmen ply their trade, fashioning crude tools and makeshift weapons from scrap metal and salvaged parts. Nomadic wanderers seek refuge, exchanging stories of their travels.  
Despite the dangers lurking beyond the safety of the trading post's walls, its inhabitants try to find solace in the bonds of community.

**The Factions**  
The Metals Guild \- buy, sell, trade metals, both ores and scrap metals.  
The Ramblers \- travel very far, make maps, bring news & stories.  
The Land Pirates \- dress like pirates, bury their “treasure” in other locations, sometimes steal from other traders on the road.  
The Storm Worshipers \- religious group that thinks they can influence the path and strength of the storms.  
The Dirt Farmers \- simple hard working people, control most of the food production in the area.

### **Scene 1: Meeting with the town leaders**

They take you through the town to a large building built from the hull of an ancient fishing boat. They tell you:  
The kidnappings have been happening for the past month. So far 3 people have disappeared. No trace of where they went. Buildings in the town have been searched. Nothing has been found. People now stay inside at night. The people being taken must have been taken somewhere else, outside the town.  
We can’t lock the town down, it's a trading post. People need to come and go.

We need you to find out who is responsible and hopefully rescue the people who were taken. The people of the town have been told about this plan, so feel free to explore the town and talk to the locals. Maybe even catch the kidnappers in the act.  
**Random townsfolk names**: 

### **Scene 2: asking around, find more clues**

A player can talk to one of the merchants or traders and ask them about what they might know. Have them roll a Social check to persuade someone to talk to them. The TN for this check is 13 for normal results and 15 for better results. If they fail the roll they get a not helpful result. You can check off the results to remember which ones the players have already received.  
FAIL:

- [ ] “My grandmother used to tell me stories about people going missing long ago. She said the only trace of them were their faces on the sides of drink containers.”  
- [ ] “People should stay indoors at night, it's their own fault they go missing.”  
- [ ] “I think people are just running away. They are all fake news\!”  
- [ ] “There’s too many people in this town anyway\!”  
- [ ] “There was a shooting star 17 days before the first kidnapping.”

SUCCESS:

- [ ] “People are going missing at night, but only when they walk alone.”  
- [ ] “Strangers come through town all the time, even at night. The walls should be closed at night\!”  
- [ ] “Some think the kidnapped people are already dead, and we should just move on. But what reason would someone have in killing random people?”  
- [ ] “I saw a fire burning in the distance the other night. Way out into the desert. They must think it is safer out there than in town.”

HIGH SUCCESS:

- [ ] “Maybe it is because everyone is nervous, but more people are wearing hoods and covering their faces now.”  
- [ ] “At least 2 of the kidnapped people had green eyes.”  
- [ ] “So far, no one from the Storm Worshippers or Dirt Farmers have gone missing. They must be next\!”  
- [ ] “Everyone is scared of each other. I asked a Storm Worshipper to trade for some liquor he had, and he wouldn’t even take an offer\!”

### **Scene 3: following up, stake out**

Players can then follow up the info they gathered. Either by talking to certain groups or by trying to set up a stake out, possibly with a person being bait for the kidnappers.

The Storm Worshippers:  
If players ask them to act as bait for a stakeout, they should roll Social vs TN15. To convince them to go with the plan. A Clever roll vs TN13 also lets them notice that the Worshippers don’t seem interested in the idea.  
“The Storm always makes things disappear. People disappearing is nothing new.”  
The Dirt Farmers:  
If the players ask them to act as bait for a stakeout, they should roll Social vs TN11. To convince them to go along with the plan. If the players heard about kidnappees having green eyes, they can have someone with green eyes to be used as bait.  
If they didn’t get that clue, they can roll Clever vs TN15 to notice that one of the farmers (who has green eyes) seems nervous. If they press them, they admit that they are nervous because they have noticed someone trying to follow them the last couple nights. They don’t know why, but they feel like they have been targeted. Players can roll a Social vs TN13 (or TN11 if players have already convinced the faction to help) to convince him to act as bait.  
“No one would dare kidnap the people who feed them.”  
Other green eyed people:  
If needed, the players can find another person with green eyes in the Ramblers faction. They might also hear about a member of the Storm Worshippers who has green eyes, but no one has seen him for a while.

Stakeout: (requires bait with green eyes)  
Players should try to spread out and hide in the town along a path. Have them roll Deft or Clever checks vs TN12 and roll 1d6 effort for each success. Their stakeout will resolve differently based on the amount of effort they got as a group. NP is the number of players.

- Bait doesn’t have green eyes. Nothing happens to them but players hear that a farmer with green eyes went missing during the night.  
- Effort \< NP \* 2\. The players are noticed by the figure before he approaches the bait. And he tries to run. If caught, they will claim they were spooked by the players hiding in the shadows.  
- Effort \< NP \* 4\. The players see the figure approach and talk to the bait and offer him a drink. The figure then notices them and leaves.  
- Effort \> NP \* 4\. The figure never notices the players hiding. They see him talk to the bait and offer him a drink. Then when he passes out, they see him drag the bait away. They can either follow them or intervene.

If players follow the figure, they can follow him to the secret hideout in the wasteland. They easily follow him to a rocky crag in some sand dunes. There is a camp set up on the crag. Once you crest the sand dunes you can easily see the burning fires of the camp.  
If players capture the figure, they can interrogate him. Do an effort test of NP \* 2 total effort vs TN of 13\. Each player gets one roll. If they succeed, the figure tells them how to get to the camp. If they fail, they will likely be forced to release him. But they can try to follow him after releasing him.

### **Scene 4: cultist hideout**

After cresting the sand dunes, the camp comes into sight. A campfire burns on a rocky crag. A handful of tents are set up around it.  
Gather Info:  
Have each player that is approaching the camp roll a Deft check vs TN13 to avoid being seen as they take a look around. Whether or not they are spotted they see the following in the camp:  
A few simple tents enclose one side of a large campfire. Between two of the tents you see a wooden cage with 2 people in it. Moving around the camp you see several small devils-like creatures. Only about 3 feet tall but with sharp claws. The campfire doesn’t have a fuel source and seems to burn from some otherworldly power.  
Not spotted: The player avoids any trouble.  
Spotted: 2 of the devil creatures follow them back to the player group and attack.  
Sneaky Rescue:  
Have each player make a Deft or Clever roll based on the way they are hiding. The TN of the enemies are what they need to beat. They can try to open the cage and free the prisoners by doing a Might check vs TN13. But the prisoners are in bad shape and will need help to escape.   
Attack the cultists:  
There are 4 human cultists and 3 devils. As the players fight to free the prisoners, the leader of the cultists will eventually sacrifice himself into the fire and cause the big creature to spawn out of the flames.  
Once the Beast is summoned, the other cultists run away.

### **Scene 5: fight the big monster**

“Out of the flames a large form appears, made mostly of tentacles. The beast rises up and lets out a horrible sound as it prepares to strike.”  
The beast heads towards the prisoners and anyone else who has green eyes. It tries to grab them and throw them into the fire.  
Because it needs the fire to burn the victims, the players can distract the beast by putting out the fire. It will have to relight the fire using a special ability with its tentacles on its next turn.

### **Scene 6: rewards back at the town**

Each player is given a special tax exemption for the town or faction they represent. Also, the Cult of the Storm building in Cheeks is emptied and the players are allowed to use it as a home base.
